Installation
============

Pre-requisites
--------------

Requires the installation of WEIS by NREL. Info on how to install it `here <https://weis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html>`_

It is recommended to use miniforge to create conda environments and install WEIS. Miniforge can be obtained `here <https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge>`_

.. note::
   
   In the following, it is assumed that you named ``weis-env`` the WEIS environment where to run SCUBE.

Installation instructions
-------------------------

1. Make sure to have the zip file “scube.zip” provided
2. Expand the file in the desired place in your disk
3. Open a conda command prompt (*if you are using miniforge, use the Miniforge Prompt*)
4. Make sure to activate the conda environment you have created to run WEIS and SCUBE (``e.g., weis-env``)
5. Navigate, within the command prompt, to the folder ``scube\dist``
6. Install the latest version of the SCUBE .whl file that you can find in that folder. For example, for SCUBE v1.0.0

.. code:: bash

   pip install scube-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl

This should install all the SCUBE scripts and all the required packages.

.. note::

   If you have installed a previous version of SCUBE, make sure to uninstall that first, and then install the new version of SCUBE, with the following command

   .. code:: bash
   
      pip uninstall scube
